# Tidy-Tuesday-
This is where I put all my code for my (admittedly amateur) tidy Tuesday contributions


I am by no means a data viz person, but I absolutely love playing around with different visualizations. It is definitely a bad habit to spend WAY too long messing around with the tiniest details on the plot that Murphy's Law dictates my supervisor will inevitably decide should be scrapped.

But, I love doing it, so I'm going to start joining in on #TidyTuesday from the RDataScience community, and this will be where all my (likely littered with errors) code will be!

Hopefully some of it could be of use to someone at some point!
